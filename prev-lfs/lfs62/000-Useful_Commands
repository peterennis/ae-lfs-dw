Type "xhost +localhost" then su to root
and all will be well. If you do this often, stick it in ~/.xinitrc to
make it the default.

Actually, for the sake of completeness, I missed a couple of small 
steps 
in there... :)

> "IP Variable Missing in
> /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0/ipv4:Cannot continue"

The problem is exactly what this line says. The variable IP wasn't set
in
the file /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0/ipv4

So. Open up that file (in vim or nano, or whatever you prefer as an
editor) and make sure there's a line like "IP=[your ip addres]".

Then run:
/etc/RC.D/init.d/network restart

Yes. I have evolution in rawhide reverted to earlier version, I believe
prior to FC2 release.

btw - I have done the "beta -> stable" thing in the past with little
problem - of course that doesn't mean there won't be one.

Stop updating about two weeks before final release - and when final
release comes out, remove the package that provides /etc/release and
install the new one from final. Check the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory -
make sure everything is pointing to stable.

then -

rpm -qa |sort > rpm.initial
yum update
rpm -qa |sort > rpm.final

compare rpm.initial and rpm.final looking for packages that remained
the
same - and see if they are newer than what is on official.

This is of course totally unsupported, as mentioned.
It's what I'm planning to do with my headless box currently running
rawhide since that is just the easiest way.

> I have FC4T2 installed on a machine.  Do I need to download and

  You may have to install fedora-release-3.92-1.i386.rpm by hand.
  Nothing I tried updated this for some reason ...

  (cat /etc/issue to check you have 3.92 not 3.91)

  I had hopes 'yum upgrade' might but it did not do anything.

/var/run/mysqld has the pid lock in it, with the

rpm -ql mysql-server 
should give you some information about where it has things.

cat /etc/issue to check you have version

rpm -ql kernel-devel    and be amazed!

Using tar and piping can also be a great way to transfer files locally to be 
sure that file permissions are kept correctly:

tar cf - /some/file | (cd /some/file; tar xf -)

This may seem like a long command, but it is great for making sure all file
permissions are kept in tact. What it is doing is streaming the files in a
sub-shell and then untarring them in the target directory.
---
e.g., create tar file foo.tar, keep permissions, gzip files
% tar cpfz foo.tar.gz /pathto/target
