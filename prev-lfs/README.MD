#README
This project will build Linux From Scratch 7.6 using bash scripts.
The difference with other such projects is that the scripts will follow
naming conventions of the book as closely as possible. It will allow
easy connection to original documentation.

##Purpose
The initial purpose of this work is to gain a strong foundation
in bash scripting. Vim will be used for writing the bash files.

##Benefits
Understanding build systems concepts, Linux architecture,
open source collaborative coding methods, and the
art of total control! [mwahaha...](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mwahaha)

##Start
This project will be kickstarted with some scripts from a previous
LFS 6.2 project. The files will be converted as necessary to the
current version, 7.6.
